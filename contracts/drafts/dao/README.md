# Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

The DAO model is analogous to a VC fund. 
Individual investors invest ether into the fund in exchange of VC shares (DAO tokens).
The fund invests ether into ventures (coded as IssuanceEth contracts) and receives back company shares (Venture tokens).
The fund collects revenue from

## Warning

This contract is rather experimental. Use with caution.

## Usage

00. Invest in this `DAO` and get dao tokens in return. You will use these tokens for voting purposes. 

0. You can restart the funding round for the DAO at any time after the initial funding round is over.

1. Beg money for `venture`. You can suggest to the `DAO` an `venture` to fund with `amount` ether. The `venture` contract must be of type `IssuanceEth`.

2. Vote for `venture`. You can vote with your `DAO` tokens. Each token is one vote. After the venture gets funded, the tokens reset (if they were expressed for that venture).

3. Fund `venture`. You can fund the `venture` if it has reached a threshold of popularity of `50% + 1` of the votes.

4. Get tokens from funded `venture`. Withdraw the tokens generated by the `venture`.

5. Get returns from tokens of fudned `venture`. Increase the pool of the `DAO` with the withdrawn tokens.

6. Update your `account`. Retrieve your fair share of the pool tokens.
